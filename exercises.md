## Week 1

- [x] Create GitHub account
- [x] Do the GitHub 'Hello World'
- [x] Add a repository for the folio
- [x] What tools (or technique) do you use to write?
- [x] How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing?) 

### Questions 

#### what types of writing do you do? (i.e., fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other?) 
I enjoy writing fiction and poetry. Specifically short stories and prose.  

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
Generally, I use my macbook pro, iphone and physical journal to write in. Most of the time I find myself free-writing from the top of my head where I allow my imagination to flow and come to me naturally. I also enjoy utilising platforms/websites that assist me in creating new content and ideas, such as rhymezone, creative writing quotes online and more. In terms of documenting my work, I am a fan of using Google Docs and Microsoft word. 

#### How do these tools shape the way you write(e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing?) 
I think these technological tools shape my writing profoundly, and in most ways, subconciously. I feel as if I have a greater tendency to edit my work and constantly change it, where technology has made me a lot more judgemental of my writing. Differently, when I write in a notebook, I find myself trying to write perfectly because I aim to not make any mistakes from the beginning. I can be a perfectionist in terms of the aesthetic and the tidiness of the pages, thus affecting the process of my writing. 


## Week 2

### How is electronic literature different from print literature?
Electronic literature's major difference from print literature is the fact that it exludes print, has been developed in a digitalised form and ultimately utilised on a computer or another electronic device. Generally, electronic literature primarily centralises around "hypertext fiction, network fiction, interactive fiction, installation pieces, "codework" and generative art." (Hayles, K 2007). 

#### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 
- whilst reading Quing's Quest I specifically noticed the correlation of political matters and the digitialised aesthetics and content. As Quing's Quest focalises on socio-political issues such as discrimination and transphobia, I instantly noticed the

##### Remix Questions: Taroko Gorge 

Within the second week of class I was introduced to digital poetry, a form of electronic literature that incorporates the use of hypertext, coding, computer-generated animation and other digital elements in order to display and interact with a work. During this class, I was presented with numerous poems that crucially relied on computation, in particular Nick Montfort’s nature poem ‘Taroko Gorge.’ 

Montfort’s electronic piece is “a mediative journey through a famous canyon in Taiwan’s Taroko National Park” (Montfort, N 2009).  It operates as a generative poem where the work produces newborn stanza’s limitlessly, enabling words flow onto a green backdrop in slow paced intervals. Here, I found that the generated sentences assisted in programming different experiences and meanings for the text, as well as creating symbolic and aesthetic appeals. Ultimately, it shaped the writing in a stimulating fashion, where it kept the reader curious for what there was to come next. 

Observing ‘Taroko Gorge’ has shown me alternative ways to express my own poetry. I learnt that digital poetry is not only created for technological reasoning, yet more with the intention of altering poetic devices such as rhythm, motifs and alliteration. As a result of analysing Montfort’s piece, I hope to crystallise these digital insights and apply them to my own practice of writing. Generally, I enjoy writing poetry concerning mental health, so this has inspired me to create a generative poem based on the waves of thoughts that enter the mind. 


###### Reflecting on Nick Monfort and Eric Snodgrass' Remixes
- To begin with, Nick Monfort & Eric Snodgrass utilise different themes within their pieces. Monfort centralises his work around the natural environment of a canyon located in Taiwan's Taroko National Park, whereas Snodgrass applies a witty sexualised theme that ultimately does not make much sense. For example, he says in his digitalised poem that "the generator sucks the thighs" and "John teases the grapefruit..."   
- Another difference was the speed of the poems, where Monfort's lines moved at a slow pace and Snodgrass' moved rapdily. I believe this is so due to the theme of the poems. Monfort's aimed to reflect a calm, natural setting that's meditative and Snodgrass' incorporates a bizarre use of language that seems as if it's constantly leading to a climax in the non-linear poem.  

###### Is the remix successful? (why or why not?)
- I think Snodgrass' piece is successful as a remix because it reflects Taroko Gorge's poem in terms of it's functions and aesthetic appearance. It's 

### notes on Electronic Literature Collection:

#### [Ars poetica] 
- words in motion, non-linear, static 

- “a text that is born and dies while reading it”

- there is a play button, pause button, and a rewind button that presents the poetic simulation backwards

##### Quing’s Quest
- the words that you can press sparkle and lead you to a new (silly and fun) subject matter 

- each word that you can press affects your future (clothing, love interest, etc)

- “Social Justice Warrior” (after a commonly-used pejorative term for those who point out misogyny, racism, transphobia and many other forms of discrimination and hatred online and in gaming culture), and features a character exiled from Videogames after the invasion of the “misogynerds.”

- “there’s music, sound effects, incisive social commentary, old-school adventure game references, a cute genderfluid pirate NPC, a working toilet, and glitter”

###### With Those We Love Alive 
- “Porpentine’s With Those We Love Alive is a Twine game that invites the reader to become physically involved through marking up their own body with symbols throughout play.”

- you can create your own identity from birth where there is hidden meanings through objects (e.g, plants) you can access different rooms and create your own future 



## Week 4

### We Walk to You Remix

#### Where the Wild Things Are

Shortly after the introduction to digital poetry, the class was shown how to create a generative poem through the software program Glitch, a web application that was founded in the 2000s by Joel Spolsky, where the application specialises in project management and content management tools, as well as code review tools. 

First, we began by remixing a poem called ‘We Walk to You’ in the Glitch software program, where I replaced the provided words in the source page with my own desired adjectives, nouns and verbs. Here, I created a non-linear poem called ‘Where the Wild Things Are,’ where I chose to centralise my theme around nature and animals. In order to achieve this, I entered ecological words and sentences into the HTML browser, such as “the crystal sea” and “the blazing sun.”  
Watching my generative poem unfold for the first time was extremely magical, especially because I hadn’t been exposed to such a tool before. It was rather entertaining observing each newborn stanza appear before my eyes, let alone recognising if the sentences made sense or not. In saying that, a fault of this tool could be that a number of sentences generated may not be coherent, however I found that these lines added a sense of humour and obscurity to the poem, rather than spoiling it.

 In total, I thoroughly enjoyed creating and watching the end product of ‘Where the Wild Things Are.’ I found that this exercise assisted me in producing poetry in a different scope, and also helped me understand basic coding techniques in digital literature. I will be definitely coming back to this web application in the future, where I hopefully will be constructing a generative poem in a more artistic approach.
