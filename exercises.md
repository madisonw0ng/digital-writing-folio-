### Questions 

#### what types of writing do you do? (i.e., fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other?) 
I enjoy writing fiction and poetry. Specifically short stories and prose.  

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
Generally, I use my macbook pro, iphone and physical journal to write in. Most of the time I find myself free-writing from the top of my head where I allow my imagination to flow and come to me naturally. I also enjoy utilising platforms/websites that assist me in creating new content and ideas, such as rhymezone, creative writing quotes online and more. In terms of documenting my work, I am a fan of using Google Docs and Microsoft word. 

#### How do these tools shape the way you write(e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing?) 
I think these technological tools shape my writing profoundly, and in most ways, subconciously. I feel as if I have a greater tendency to edit my work and constantly change it, where technology has made me a lot more judgemental of my writing. Differently, when I write in a notebook, I find myself trying to write perfectly because I aim to not make any mistakes from the beginning. I can be a perfectionist in terms of the aesthetic and the tidiness of the pages, thus affecting the process of my writing.
