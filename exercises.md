### Questions 

#### what types of writing do you do? (i.e., fiction, nonfiction, poetry, other?) 
I enjoy writing fiction and poetry. Specifically short stories and prose.  

#### What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?
Generally, I use my macbook pro, iphone and physical journal to write in. Most of the time I find myself free-writing from the top of my head where I allow my imagination to flow and come to me naturally. I also enjoy utilising platforms/websites that assist me in creating new content and ideas, such as rhymezone, creative writing quotes online and more. In terms of documenting my work, I am a fan of using Google Docs and Microsoft word. 

#### How do these tools shape the way you write(e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing?) 
I think these technological tools shape my writing profoundly, and in most ways, subconciously. I feel as if I have a greater tendency to edit my work and constantly change it, where technology has made me a lot more judgemental of my writing. Differently, when I write in a notebook, I find myself trying to write perfectly because I aim to not make any mistakes from the beginning. I can be a perfectionist in terms of the aesthetic and the tidiness of the pages, thus affecting the process of my writing. 


## Week 2

### How is electronic literature different from print literature?
Electronic literature's major difference from print literature is the fact that it exludes print, has been developed in a digitalised form and ultimately utilised on a computer or another electronic device. Generally, electronic literature primarily centralises around "hypertext fiction, network fiction, interactive fiction, installation pieces, "codework" and generative art." (Hayles, K 2007). 

#### What are some of the qualities of electronic literature? 
- whilst reading Quing's Quest I specifically noticed the correlation of political matters and the digitialised aesthetics and content. As Quing's Quest focalises on socio-political issues such as discrimination and transphobia, I instantly noticed the

### notes on Electronic Literature Collection:

#### [Ars poetica] 
- words in motion, non-linear, static 

- “a text that is born and dies while reading it”

- there is a play button, pause button, and a rewind button that presents the poetic simulation backwards

##### Quing’s Quest
- the words that you can press sparkle and lead you to a new (silly and fun) subject matter 

- each word that you can press affects your future (clothing, love interest, etc)

- “Social Justice Warrior” (after a commonly-used pejorative term for those who point out misogyny, racism, transphobia and many other forms of discrimination and hatred online and in gaming culture), and features a character exiled from Videogames after the invasion of the “misogynerds.”

- “there’s music, sound effects, incisive social commentary, old-school adventure game references, a cute genderfluid pirate NPC, a working toilet, and glitter”

###### With Those We Love Alive 
- “Porpentine’s With Those We Love Alive is a Twine game that invites the reader to become physically involved through marking up their own body with symbols throughout play.”
